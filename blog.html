          <p class=" text-sm md:text-xl bg-slate-500 p-5 rounded-lg text-white"><span class="font-bold text-2xl underline">var:</span>

            Variables declared with var are function-scoped, which means they are accessible only within the function in which they are defined.var declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. This means you can use a var variable before it's actually declared in the code, but it will be initialized with undefined.</p>
            <p class="text-sm md:text-xl bg-slate-500 p-5 rounded-lg text-white"><span class="font-bold text-2xl underline">let:</span>

                 Variables declared with let have block-level scope, which means they are accessible only within the block (e.g., inside loops, conditionals, or functions) in which they are defined.
                No hoisting: Unlike var, let variables are not hoisted. You cannot access them before their declaration.

            <p class="text-sm md:text-xl bg-slate-500 p-5 rounded-lg text-white"><span class="font-bold text-2xl underline">Const:</span>

                Block-scoped: Like let, variables declared with const are block-scoped.
                Constant value: Variables declared with const are constants, meaning their value cannot be reassigned after declaration. However, it's important to note that the value itself is not necessarily immutable. If a const variable holds an object or array, you can modify the properties or elements of that object or array.
                No hoisting: const variables are not hoisted.

          What do you mean by REST API?

        <div class="collapse-content"> 
          <p class="text-sm md:text-xl bg-slate-500 p-5 rounded-lg text-white">REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural principles and constraints for designing and interacting with web services. REST is not a specific technology but rather a style of designing networked applications that use the HTTP protocol.
